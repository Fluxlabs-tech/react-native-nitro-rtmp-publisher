//  HybridRtmpPublisherView.swift
//  NitroRtmpPublisher
//
//  iOS implementation of the Nitro view. Mirrors the Android
//  RootEncoder-backed publisher; uses HaishinKit 2.2.x under the hood
//  (MediaMixer + RTMPConnection/Stream actors).
//
//  This file holds the class declaration, all stored state, the Nitro
//  prop setters (`didSet` handlers), and the lifecycle entry points
//  (`init`, `deinit`, `onDropView`). All behavior is split across topical
//  extensions to keep this file readable:
//
//    HybridRtmpPublisherView+Streaming.swift   — RTMP transport, reconnect
//                                                machinery, encoder
//                                                settings, bitrate timer,
//                                                NetStream status events.
//    HybridRtmpPublisherView+Capture.swift     — camera & mic attach,
//                                                preview, mirror /
//                                                stabilization, all
//                                                per-device controls
//                                                (zoom / exposure / focus
//                                                / torch), audio session.
//    HybridRtmpPublisherView+Recording.swift   — local MP4 recording.
//    HybridRtmpPublisherView+Lifecycle.swift   — app background/foreground,
//                                                AVCaptureSession
//                                                interruption, orientation
//                                                and thermal observers.
//    HybridRtmpPublisherView+Events.swift      — JS callback setters and
//                                                the `emit*` helpers that
//                                                hop them to main.
//    HybridRtmpPublisherView+UrlHelpers.swift  — RTMP URL parsing +
//                                                credential sanitization.
//
//  Standalone:
//    PublisherBitrateStrategy.swift            — custom HK
//                                                `StreamBitRateStrategy`.
//    PublisherMappings.swift                   — type-bridging extensions
//                                                (Nitro enums → AVFoundation
//                                                / ProcessInfo).
//
//  Architecture note: Nitro view methods are synchronous (or `throws`) but
//  HaishinKit 2.x's API is actor-based and async. We bridge by:
//   - caching state locally for synchronous getters (`isStreaming`,
//     `getZoom`, `getCurrentBitrate`, …) — the cache is updated whenever
//     we mutate the underlying actor state
//   - wrapping all setters in detached `Task { ... }` work — fire-and-
//     forget, errors logged but not surfaced because the JS-facing method
//     doesn't have anywhere to return them
//   - consuming `connection.status` + `stream.status` AsyncStreams in
//     long-lived Tasks (with `pipelineGeneration` guards to drop stale
//     events from torn-down actors).

  // `mixer.attachVideo` is a HEAVY actor call: HaishinKit wraps it in an

  // old AVCaptureDeviceInput and constructs a fresh one (spins up the new
  // camera hardware) — ~0.4-1.0s on-device. MediaMixer is a serial actor, so N
  // rapid Flip taps would otherwise enqueue N of these back-to-back and freeze
  // the UI for several seconds before draining.
  //
  // We coalesce: only ONE attach runs at a time. While one is in flight, a tap
  // just updates the intent (`currentFacing` / `currentDevice`) and sets
  // `cameraAttachPending`. When the in-flight attach finishes, its tail does AT
  // MOST ONE reconverge attach to the latest intent.
  //
  // Result: any burst of N taps collapses into 1 attach (intent unchanged, e.g.
  // even taps back→…→back) or 2 attaches (1 initial + 1 reconverge, e.g. odd
  // taps), and always lands on the correct final facing.
  //
  // THREADING — these flags are mutated ONLY on the main thread. The entry-point
  // Nitro methods (switchCamera / switchCameraById / startPreview / stopPreview)
  // run on the JS thread (the generated bridge calls them with no hop), so they
  // do NOT touch these flags directly: they route through requestCameraAttach(),
  // which hops to main via `onMain` before reading/writing them; the attach tail
  // and finalizeMirror also run on main. So `flipMaskToken` / `mirrorGeneration`
  // and these two Bools are all single-threaded → a plain Bool/UInt64 is genuinely
  // race-free. (The INTENT vars currentFacing/currentDevice are still set on the
  // JS thread, but the attach reads them on main after a dispatch barrier and the
  // reconverge re-checks them, so reading the freshest intent is correct.) Reset
  // in stopPreview / onDropView (both via onMain) so a view that drops mid-attach

  // generation it was born under and only commits its mirror write if it's
  // still the latest. This makes mirror last-writer-wins DETERMINISTIC:
  // whichever flip is newest owns the final value, so a heavy in-flight
  // attach from an OLD flip can't clobber a NEWER flip's mirror when its tail
